This is my first project within the Odin Project cirriculum.

The objective of this project is to make a recipes webpage.

And, I'll be showcasing food recipes from MF DOOM's "MM..FOOD" album

By completing this project, I will be demonstrating my foundation knowledge of HTML.

In other words, I will be using different HTML elements like lists, links, and images.

Finally, I'll be using Git & GitHub to publish my finalized product.
