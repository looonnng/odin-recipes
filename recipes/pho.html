    <h2> What is Pho? </h2>
    <p> Pho is a soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, thinly-sliced meat (in this recipe, it's beef), and fresh garnishes. </p>
    <h2> Where is Pho From? </h2>
    <p> As with many foods, the origins of pho are unknown. It is believed to have been created in northern Vietnam in the early 20th century. It gained popularity in many countries after the Vietnam War.</p>
    <h2>Pho Ingredients </h2>
    <p> Because you're making this authentic Vietnamese soup completely from scratch, the ingredient list is a little hefty. Here's what you'll need: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef Soup Bones</li>
        <li>Rice Noodles</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings</li>
        <li>Granishes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p> Pho is quite simple to make, it's just a little time consuming. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below â€” but here's what you can expect when making this pho: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Roast the beef bones and onions until the bones are browned and the onions are soft. </li>
        <li> Combine roasted beef bones, roasted onions, ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and water in a large stockpot. Allow to simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Then, strain the broth into a new saucepan. </li>
        <li> Allow dry rice noodles to soak for 1 hour. While they're soaking, bring broth to a simmer. </li>
        <li> Cook the rice noodles in boiling water. Drain and add noodles to a bowl topped with sirloin, cilantro, green onion, and broth. Garnish with your desired toppings. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <h3> How to Store Pho </h3>
    <p> Store broth and rice noodles separately in their own airtight containers in the fridge. They will stay fresh for up to four days. When you're ready to eat, reheat the broth on the stove and rice noodles in the microwave. Combine and enjoy. </p>
    <h3> How to Freeze Pho </h3>
    <p> You can only freeze the pho broth, not the rice noodles. Store completely cooled broth in airtight containers or zip-top freezer bags (frozen flat) in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove. </p>
